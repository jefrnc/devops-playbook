## 🚀 Quick Start

### Calculate Your DORA Metrics

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jefrnc/devops-playbook.git
cd devops-playbook

# Install dependencies
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt

# Calculate deployment frequency
cd scripts/DeploymentFrequency
python deployment_frequency.py --config config.yaml

# Generate comprehensive report
python deployment_frequency.py --report
```

### Example Output
```text
DEPLOYMENT FREQUENCY REPORT
