2. Move to [DevOps Culture and Transformation](./DevOps%20Culture%20and%20Transformation.md)
3. Learn about [Continuous Integration and Delivery](./Continuous%20Integration%20and%20Delivery.md)
4. Explore [Infrastructure as Code](./Infrastructure%20as%20Code.md)

### For Practitioners
1. Deep dive into [Monitoring and Logging](./Monitoring%20and%20Logging.md)
2. Implement [Security](./Security.md) best practices
3. Study [Site Reliability Engineering](./Site%20Reliability%20Engineering%20(SRE).md)
4. Explore [GitOps](./gitops/README.md) and [Platform Engineering](./platform-engineering/README.md)

### For Teams
1. Focus on [Collaboration and Communication](./Collaboration%20and%20Communication.md)
2. Learn [Incident Management and Postmortems](./Incident%20Management%20and%20Postmortems.md)
3. Understand [DevOps Performance Metrics](./DevOps%20Performance%20Metrics.md)

- **Measurement**: Use data to drive decisions and improvements

## üìã Prerequisites

To get the most from this playbook:
- Basic understanding of software development
- Familiarity with version control (Git)
- Access to cloud platforms or on-premises infrastructure
- Willingness to embrace cultural change
