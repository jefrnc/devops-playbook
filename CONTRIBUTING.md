## Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

We follow PEP 8 with these additions:

```python
# Good: Descriptive variable names
deployment_frequency = calculate_deployment_frequency(start_date, end_date)

# Good: Type hints
def calculate_mttr(incidents: List[Incident]) -> float:
    """Calculate Mean Time to Recovery."""
    pass

# Good: Comprehensive docstrings
def process_deployment(deployment_id: str) -> DeploymentResult:
    """
    Process a deployment and return its result.
    
    Args:
        deployment_id: Unique identifier for the deployment
        
    Returns:
        DeploymentResult object containing status and metrics
        
    Raises:
        DeploymentError: If deployment processing fails
    """
    pass
```

### Documentation Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Add diagrams where helpful
- Follow this structure:
  ```markdown
  # Feature Name
  
  ## Overview
  Brief description
  
  ## Prerequisites
  What's needed
  
  ## Usage
  How to use it
  
  ## Examples
  Real examples
  
  ## Troubleshooting
  Common issues
  ```

### Commit Messages

Follow the conventional commits specification:

```

```

## Testing

### Python Scripts

```python
# tests/test_deployment_frequency.py
def test_calculate_deployment_frequency():
    """Test deployment frequency calculation."""
    deployments = [
        {'timestamp': '2024-01-01T10:00:00Z', 'status': 'success'},
        {'timestamp': '2024-01-02T10:00:00Z', 'status': 'success'},
    ]
    
    result = calculate_deployment_frequency(deployments)
    assert result['daily_average'] == 2.0
    assert result['performance_level'] == 'Elite'
```
